        <p>
            Hello! I am a Software Developer who graduated in 2015 from the
            University of New Hampshire with a B.S. in Computer Science. I live
            in Stratham, NH and I am currently employed with Pegasystems Inc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Below are some of my favorite projects that I have worked on with
            relevant links at the top right of each section.

            I created the website you are currently browsing from scratch. The
            goal was to hone my skills with CSS transitions. A secondary goal
            was to show off this domain name; I am proud of its cleverness!
        </p>
        <p>
            In actual time spent on this project, I would say that this one took
            me about 2 weeks to complete; being a perfectionist certainly does
            not expedite the process. I am most pleased with how clean the
            Javascript is despite there being so much going on with page load
            transitions and having to keep track of which page the user is on.
            This is by no means a technically advanced project, but I hope you
            agree that this is the most visually polished!

                    Split Diff is an Atom package that compares code
                    side-by-side and highlights any differences. I began using
                    the open source Atom text editor at my first full time job.
                    At the time, the editor was freshly out of beta and I sorely
                    noticed that there was no package available to diff two
                    files. I mainly developed this package for myself, but as
                    you can see by clicking the Atom icon to the right, it has
                    been well received!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Developing Split Diff has given me valuable experience with
                    the open source community. It has also given me quite a lot
                    of headaches trying to work within the bounds of an API. I
                    have had to do some pretty interesting things to work around
                    the fact that there is no easy way to add unnumbered lines
                    into an editor window.

                    Extraterrestrial Navigational Swarm was my senior project at
                    UNH. The goal of the project was to create a swarm of robots
                    that would be able to implement any swarming algorithm
                    thrown at it - specifically the Partical Swarm Optimization
                    algorithm. This algorithm would allow the robots to
                    cooperatively search an area to find the highest value (ex:
                    altitude).
                </p>
                <p>
                    To achieve the goal, I was in charge of getting all of the
                    devices on the robot to communicate with one another. The
                    Arduino Mega was used to drive the motors and collect
                    locational data. This data needed to be passed to the
                    Raspberry Pi Model B+ for the swarming algorithm. Then a
                    subset of the data needed to be broadcast to the rest of the
                    swarm in mesh networking mode via Zigbee devices.

                <p>
                    The ET-NavSwarm project was an invaluable experience. The
                    greatest reward to all of the hard work we put into the
                    project was getting to visit NASA's Goddard Space Flight
                    Center. I experienced some amazing things there, including
                    the Hubble Space Telescope Operations Control Center, the
                    assembly of the James Webb Space Telescope in the world's
                    largest clean room, and finally being able to present our
                    research to top NASA engineers.

            Kappafeed listens in top

            channels for specified emoticons and displays them in one collective

            merge the top chat channels into one.

            I learned a lot from this project about maintaining servers and
            keeping a service running reliably 24/7. Admittedly, the code for
            this project quickly grew out of control as more features were added
            and bugs that would cause the service to crash were fixed. I
            think at this point, the effort of code refactor would outweigh the
            benefits. I am not ashamed to admit how monstrous this code became
            because it taught me valuable lessons for future projects.
