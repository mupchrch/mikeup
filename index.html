        <p>
          Hello! I am a Software Developer who graduated in 2015 from the
          University of New Hampshire with a B.S. in Computer Science. I live
          in Stratham, NH and I am currently employed with Pegasystems Inc.
        </p>

          Below are some of my favorite projects that I have worked on with
          relevant links at the top right of each section.

        <p>
          I created the website you are currently browsing from scratch. The
          goal was to hone my skills with CSS transitions. A secondary goal
          was to show off this domain name; I am proud of its cleverness!
        </p>
        <p>
          In actual time spent on this project, I would say that this one took
          me about 2 weeks to complete; being a perfectionist certainly does
          not expedite the process. I am most pleased with how clean the
          Javascript is despite there being so much going on with page load
          transitions and having to keep track of which page the user is on.
          This is by no means a technically advanced project, but I hope you
          agree that this is the most visually polished!

              Split Diff is an Atom package that compares code
              side-by-side and highlights any differences. I began using
              the open source Atom text editor at my first full time job.
              At the time, the editor was freshly out of beta and I sorely
              noticed that there was no package available to diff two
              files. I mainly developed this package for myself, but as
              you can see by clicking the Atom icon to the right, it has
              been well received!
            </p>
            <p>
              Developing Split Diff has given me valuable experience with
              the open source community. It has also given me quite a lot
              of headaches trying to work within the bounds of an API. I
              have had to do some pretty interesting things to work around
              the fact that there is no easy way to add unnumbered lines
              into an editor window.

              Extraterrestrial Navigational Swarm was my senior project at
              UNH. The goal of the project was to create a swarm of robots
              that would be able to implement any swarming algorithm
              thrown at it - specifically the Partical Swarm Optimization
              algorithm. This algorithm would allow the robots to
              cooperatively search an area to find the highest value (ex:
              altitude).
            </p>
            <p>
              To achieve the goal, I was in charge of getting all of the
              devices on the robot to communicate with one another. The
              Arduino Mega was used to drive the motors and collect
              locational data. This data needed to be passed to the
              Raspberry Pi Model B+ for the swarming algorithm. Then a
              subset of the data needed to be broadcast to the rest of the
              swarm in mesh networking mode via Zigbee devices.
            </p>
            <p>
              The ET-NavSwarm project was an invaluable experience. The
              greatest reward to all of the hard work we put into the
              project was getting to visit NASA's Goddard Space Flight
              Center. I experienced some amazing things there, including
              the Hubble Space Telescope Operations Control Center, the
              assembly of the James Webb Space Telescope in the world's
              largest clean room, and finally being able to present our
              research to top NASA engineers.

          I learned a lot from this project about maintaining servers and
          keeping a service running reliably 24/7. Admittedly, the code for
          this project quickly grew out of control as more features were added
          and bugs that would cause the service to crash were fixed. I
          think at this point, the effort of code refactor would outweigh the
          benefits. I am not ashamed to admit how monstrous this code became
          because it taught me valuable lessons for future projects.
