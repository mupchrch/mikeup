          Updash is a personalized information dashboard for my home. It

          It is built using Smashing (a Ruby-based framework for quickly
          building dashboards) and runs on a Raspberry Pi connected to a

          no longer working or did not exist.

          This project started as an excuse to learn Node, then exploded into an
          opportunity to learn many more aspects of creating and running a web
          app:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            I began with MongoDB and Mongoose which served me well in the
            beginning. I quickly realized what I actually needed was a relational
            database, so I chose Postgres with node-postgres. Choosing a lower level
            library like node-postgres allowed me to actually learn to write SQL
            queries.
          </li>
          <li>
            I chose to roll my own user authentication via JSON Web Tokens, as
            this was another aspect of web apps that I wanted to learn more about.
          </li>
          <li>
            All server APIs are unit tested. All unit tests run with each commit
            via CircleCI.
          </li>
          <li>
            I learned how to set up a production Node server running via PM2 on a
            Digital Ocean droplet with an SSL certificate.

          with CSS transitions and understanding static websites a bit more. I
          have more recently gone back and updated the CSS to provide a better

        <p>
          Split Diff is an Atom text editor package that compares code
          side-by-side and highlights any differences. I began using
          Atom at my first full time job. At the time, the editor was freshly
          out of beta and I noticed there was no package available to diff
          files. Even though I don't use the package much anymore, I have
          continued to support it.
        </p>
        <img src="images/split-diff.gif" title="Split Diff" alt="Split Diff"></img>
        <p>
          Developing Split Diff has given me valuable experience with the
          open source community. It has also given me quite a lot of
          practice with trying to work within the bounds of an API. I have
          had to do some pretty interesting workarounds to do things like
          keep the two editor scroll positions in sync, add empty lines so
          the diff chunks stay visibly next to each other, run the diffing
          calculations on a separate Node process so the UI doesn't freeze,
          etc.
        </p>
        <p>
          Another popular Atom package,
          <a href="https://atom.io/packages/git-time-machine" target="_blank">Git Time Machine</a>,
          is built on top of Split Diff, and I have worked with the developer of
          that package to expose necessary hooks into my package. I have also developed
          two other Atom packages:
          <a href="https://atom.io/packages/minimap-split-diff" target="_blank">Minimap Split Diff</a>
          and
          <a href="https://atom.io/packages/outline-selection" target="_blank">Outline Selection</a>.

          My senior project at UNH was Extraterrestrial Navigational Swarm.
          The goal of the project was to create a swarm of robots that would
          be able to implement any swarming algorithm thrown at it -
          specifically the Partical Swarm Optimization algorithm. This
          algorithm would allow the robots to cooperatively search an area
          to find the lowest altitude.

          To achieve the goal, I was in charge of getting all of the
          devices on the robot to communicate with one another. The
          Arduino Mega was used to drive the motors and collect
          locational data. This data needed to be passed to the
          Raspberry Pi Model B+ for the swarming algorithm. Then a
          subset of the data needed to be broadcast to the rest of the
          swarm in mesh networking mode via Zigbee devices.

          The ET-NavSwarm project was an invaluable experience. The
          greatest reward for all of the hard work we put into the
          project was getting to visit NASA's Goddard Space Flight
          Center. I experienced some amazing things there, including
          the Hubble Space Telescope Operations Control Center, the
          assembly of the James Webb Space Telescope in the world's
          largest clean room, and finally, being able to present our
          research to top NASA engineers.

          Kappafeed is a program that listens in top
          <a href="http://www.twitch.tv" target="_blank">Twitch.tv</a>
          channels for specified emoticons and displays them in one collective
          feed. It integrates with Twitch APIs and IRC servers in order to
          merge the top chat channels into one.
        </p>
        <p>
          At one point, I created a Kappafeed
          <a href="https://www.overwolf.com/app/Michael_Upchurch-Kappafeed" target="_blank">Overwolf app</a>
          for a contest they were hosting and actually won a gaming headset.

          I learned a lot from this project about maintaining servers and
          keeping a service running reliably 24/7. The code for this project got
          a bit unruly as more features were added and bugs that would cause the
          service to crash were fixed. I learned valuable lessons about code
          refactor and structure for future projects.
