Another popular Atom package, <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/git-time-machine\"><code class=\"language-text\">git-time-machine</code></a>, is built on top of <code class=\"language-text\">split-diff</code>. I worked with the package maintainer to provide an API so that <code class=\"language-text\">split-diff</code> could be easily used as a dependency. Even though I don’t use the package as much anymore, I have continued to support it, as it still has a significant userbase, and I enjoy contributing back to open source.</p>\n<p>I have encountered and overcome a fair amount of interesting problems as I developed <code class=\"language-text\">split-diff</code>, and maintained it over the years:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Keeping the two editor scroll positions in sync, both vertically and horizontally, and handle files with different line counts and widths. There was, and still is, no provided API for doing this.</li>\n<li>Adding empty lines, so the diff chunks stay visibly next to each other, despite having differing amounts of lines. There was no API for doing so at the time, but I was able to refactor at some point to use a newly released API for specifically this reason.</li>\n<li>Running the diffing calculations on a separate child process, so the UI wouldn’t lock up.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><a href=\"https://github.com/mupchrch/split-diff\">View the source on Github.</a></p>\n<p>I have also developed two other smaller Atom packages: <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/minimap-split-diff\"><code class=\"language-text\">minimap-split-diff</code></a> and <a href=\"https://atom.io/packages/outline-selection\"><code class=\"language-text\">outline-selection</code></a>.</p>\n<h3 id=\"technologies\" style=\"position:relative;\"><a href=\"#technologies\" aria-label=\"technologies permalink\" class=\"anchor before\"><svg aria-hidden=\"true\" focusable=\"false\" height=\"16\" version=\"1.1\" viewBox=\"0 0 16 16\" width=\"16\"><path fill-rule=\"evenodd\" d=\"M4 9h1v1H4c-1.5 0-3-1.69-3-3.5S2.55 3 4 3h4c1.45 0 3 1.69 3 3.5 0 1.41-.91 2.72-2 3.25V8.59c.58-.45 1-1.27 1-2.09C10 5.22 8.98 4 8 4H4c-.98 0-2 1.22-2 2.5S3 9 4 9zm9-3h-1v1h1c1 0 2 1.22 2 2.5S13.98 12 13 12H9c-.98 0-2-1.22-2-2.5 0-.83.42-1.64 1-2.09V6.25c-1.09.53-2 1.84-2 3.25C6 11.31 7.55 13 9 13h4c1.45 0 3-1.69 3-3.5S14.5 6 13 6z\"></path></svg></a>Technologies</h3>\n<p><em>Coffeescript, Javascript, Less</em></p>","frontmatter":{"title":"split-diff","date":"February 02, 2016","description":"A side-by-side compare package for the Atom text editor."}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/about/split-diff/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/about/et-navswarm/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"ET-NavSwarm"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/about/upchat/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"upchat"}}}},"staticQueryHashes":["3296784666","63159454"],"slicesMap":{}}
